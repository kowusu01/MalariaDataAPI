Adding filtering, sorting and ordering to efcore

Approach
 - add extension method to efcore dbcontext to apply the query actions filtering, sorting and ordering to the appropraiet collection
 - the query actions are added to the efcore query builder but not executed
 - all query actions are translated to sql and executed on the db side
 - in a layered app, the class the has access the efcore is the one that can perform this task


 Running the app
 a) in visual studio
 1. inspect the file under Properties/launchSettins.json
    - note the params provided under each profile
 2. select the profile you waqnt to use
 3. create the secrets file to hold the configuration values needed in that profile
 
 b) running under docker
 1. build the app
 2. publish the app, note the folder where the publised files are located
 3. navigate to the publish folder under the current configuration (Debug or Release), to where the dlls are located
 4. create the image, e.g. build with image name malaria-api
   - docker build -t malaria-api . 
 5. run the image, interactively so you can see the logs
   - docker run -ti -e DataSourceType="InMemory" -e DBInstance="malariadb_dev" -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT="Development" --name=api.malaria.dev  malaria-api

For some reason, dotnetcore seems to assign 7096 for the swagger port,
use the following to access the api
 https://localhost:7096/swagger/index.html
